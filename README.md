# XI. BASIC Context History 

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Here comes the 11th video of twenty-four on the theory of artificial thought:

In this video, there are shown two utmostly simplified experiments with the hope to show the basis of "replying in context".

The idea is that "the present" is not only what is presently perceived, but also the most recent history of interaction. (This history of interaction is subject to evolution.) By taking into account the most recent history as part of a "challenge", a more intelligent reply can be given. This is a universal principle, applicable to all manners of thought.

Both experiment can be run by BWBASIC or any other BASIC  interpreter of your choice that is compatible with QBASIC.

Background:

I believe intelligence truly is about predicting replies to challenges by using past experience.

It has been criticised in AI that when you "think of something" or "talk of something", you really "mean" a lot of implied context. (This has been a problem of automatic translation since the 1950s and 1960s.) So "simply replying to the actually perceived present" is not going to suffice, unless the present is defined BEYOND current perception.

I am showing that this "context" can be simply given by the "most recent interaction". By "keeping a history" of what is happening, you can "predict the future" much more reliably.

In these two experiments, the goal is "to reply with a number to a number". (A number is standing here for a "concept" or "unit of interaction".)

Due to the history of past interactions, the system can do the reply "intelligently". Moreover, the knowledge is subject to evolution as the history changes.

While this is ultra-simplified, later on I will show chat-bots and robots operating on this principle quite successfully.
